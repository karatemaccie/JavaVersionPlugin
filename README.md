# JavaVersionPlugin
Plugin for Bukkit, Spigot and Bungeecord which simply shows your java-version.

It also has something you could call an API. The nl.karatemaccie.javaversion.api.JavaVersionAPI contains reusable code. Yours to take!

It has only one command:

/javaversion

With the permission:
karatemaccie.javaversion

It gives you the version of java you have.
I tried to make it work with java 9, if that follows the version-standard like java 7 and 8.
